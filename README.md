**CRM Project – Healthcare Patient Engagement & Care Management**


Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Goal: Identify the gaps in patient engagement and care management, and define why Salesforce CRM is needed.
• Problem Statement:
Hospitals and clinics face challenges such as low patient engagement, delayed follow-ups, manual record tracking and lack of coordinated care. Doctors and nurses cannot intervene early for at-risk patients, patients lack clarity on treatment plans, and administrators lack real-time insights into patient outcomes.

• Why Salesforce?
Salesforce Health Cloud provides customizable objects, automation tools, dashboards and integrations (EHR, LIS, SMS gateways, telemedicine platforms) that can track patients, detect risks early, and coordinate care plans.

• Stakeholders:
- Patients → View treatment plans, Lab results, appointments, risk alerts.
- Doctors/Nurses → Monitor patient progress, flag at-risk cases, track adherence.
- Care Coordinators → Recommended care plans, follow up with patients.
- Admins → Oversee hospital operations, patient metrics, treatment effectiveness.

• KPIs to Improve:
- Patient adherence to treatment plans.
- Follow-up compliance rate.
- Reduction in hospital readmission %.
- Patient satisfaction and engagement score.

• Business Flow Example:
Patient visits hospital → Appointment & lab results updated → System calculates risk score → If below threshold, alert triggered → Doctor/Nurse intervenes → Care coordinator updates care plan → Patient engagement dashboard updated.

Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration
Goal: Set up Salesforce environment for healthcare workflows.
• Profiles:
- Patient (view own data only).
- Doctor/Nurses (view/edit assigned patient records).
- Care coordinator (view/edit care plans for patients).
- Admin (full access).

• Roles: Hospital → Department → Doctor/Nurse → Patient.

• Permissions & Sharing:
- Patient → Private access (own records only).
- Doctors/Nurses → Access only assigned department Patients.
- Care Coordinators → Access to all care plans.
- Admins → Full visibility.

• Settings:
- Fiscal Year → Hospital Reporting Year (Jan– Dec).
- Business Hours → 8 AM – 8 PM (for care follow-ups).
- Login IP Restrictions → Hospital network only for Admins/Doctors/Nurses.

---

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships
Goal: Build a patient-centric data structure.
• Custom Objects:
- Patient__c → Name, Patient ID, Age, Dept, Email, Contact Number.
- Appointment__c → Date, Time, doctor, linked to patient.
- Treatment__c → Diagnosis, Medication, Therapy, linked to Patient.
- Lab_Result__c → Test Name, Date, Result, linked to Patient.
- Care_Plan__c → Recommended Treatments, Follow-ups, linked Doctors.

• Relationships:
- Patient ↔ Appointment (Master-Detail).
- Patient ↔ Treatment (Master-Detail).
- Patient ↔ Lab_Result (Lookup).
- Patient ↔ Care_Plan (Lookup).

• Schema Builder Use: Visualize entire patient management data model with relationships between patients, treatments, appointments, lab results, and care plans.

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)
Goal: Automate patient care, reminders and administrative workflows.
• Validation Rules:
- Ensure patient contact information and treatment start dates are mandatory.

• Process Builder:
- If patient risk score < threshold → Assign task to doctor/nurse.

• Approval Processes:
- If treatment plan, insurance claim, or lab result exception submitted → Route to approval→ Approve/Reject.

• Tasks & Notifications:
- Care team gets task → “Follow up with patient.”
- Doctor/nurse/patient receives push notification → “Check updates or reminders.”

---

Phase 5: Apex Development (Developer)
Goal: Implement advanced logic and asynchronous processing for patient care.
• Apex Triggers:
- Automate patient record updates, appointment status, and treatment logs.

• Batch Apex:
- Process large volumes of patient or lab data asynchronously.

• Queueable Apex & Scheduled Apex:
- Automate notifications, periodic care plan checks, and alerts.

• SOQL & SOQL:
- Efficiently query and search patient records, treatments, and lab results.

• Test Classes:
- Validate triggers and classes for deployment readiness.

---

Phase 6: User Interface Development
Goal: Create intuitive interfaces for doctors, nurses, patients, and admins.
• Record Pages & Dashboards:
- Doctors: Treatment history & patient updates.
- Nurses: Daily tasks, medication reminders.
- Coordinators: Follow-up scheduling & patient communication.
- Admins: Overall hospital/clinic performance insights.

• Lightning Web Components (LWCs):
- Patient intake forms for quick registration.
- Appointment scheduler with real-time availability.
- Risk score visualization for at-risk patients.
- Integration with Apex for fetching and updating patient data.

---

Phase 7: Integration & External Access
Goal: Integrate CRM with external healthcare systems and ensure secure data exchange.
• Web Services (REST/SOAP), Callouts: Enable bi-directional data exchange.
• Platform Events, Change Data Capture, Salesforce Connect: Receive real-time updates from external systems.
• API Limits, OAuth & Authentication, Remote Site Settings: Maintain security and manage data flow limits.

---

Phase 8: Data Management & Deployment
Goal: Ensure accurate patient data and smooth deployment processes.
• Data Loader: Upload existing patient records, appointments, and treatment histories.
• Duplicate Rules: Avoid duplicate patient entries.
• Data Export & Backup: Regularly backup critical patient data.
• VS Code & SFDX: Advanced development, version control, and deployment.

---

Phase 9: Reporting & Dashboards
Goal: Provide actionable insights for patient engagement, treatment adherence, and hospital performance.
• Reports (Tabular, Summary, Matrix, Joined) & Report Types:
- Tabular Reports → Simple patient lists (e.g., patients with missed appointments).
- Summary Reports → Group data by doctor, department, or treatment type.
- Custom Report Types → Build specialized reports (e.g., “At-Risk Patients by Department”).

• Dashboards:
- Hospital KPIs→ Bed occupancy, patient satisfaction, and treatment success rate.
- Dynamic Dashboard → Role-based views.
- Care team performance metrics → Track tasks completed by doctors/nurses.
- Visualizations → Charts, gauges, and tables for easy insights.

---

Phase 10: Final Demo & Presentation
Goal: Present working solution.
• 🖥️ Demo Walkthrough:
- Patient Intake → Register patient with mandatory details and validations.
- Appointment Scheduling → Book slots with real-time availability and auto-confirmations.
- Care Plan Management → Track treatments, assign follow-up tasks, and monitor progress.
- Risk Alerts → Flag at-risk patients and notify doctors/nurses instantly.
